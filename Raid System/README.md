# Point-Based Raid System

This was by one of my hardest project to script just due to the vast complexity of it. This system is made up of a number of different components, notably the two different GUI Panels which both have their own purpose and functionality.

The major issue I ran into with this project happened to be the actual incrementing/decrementing of points and the countdown timer as opposed to other things such as teams, team caps and group retrieval etc.
