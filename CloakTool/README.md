#  Cloak Tool

This is a simple script that will activate an invisibility cloak on the player who activates. This version of the script is only configured to work based on a player's given team. If you want to see the Filtered version of the module, see "CloakToolSecure".

This can  be configured to enable specific teams to see eachother in a "translucent" state (transparency = 0.5).
