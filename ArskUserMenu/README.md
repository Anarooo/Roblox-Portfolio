# ArskUserMenu

ArskUserMenu is a project in which I designed the UI and scripted the backend for an entire Main Menu. This menu contains many features including 3 functional pages for different things including:
 - An Update Log or Information Page
 - Credits/Development Staff/Staff Team (Moderators) with functional and up-to-date User Icons
 - A blank page available for extra functionality (such as a team changer).

I have not published the source-code of this project due to its quality of production, however the menu can be located here: https://www.roblox.com/games/12403564709/ArskUserMenu
