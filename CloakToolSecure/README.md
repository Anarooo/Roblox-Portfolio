#  Cloak Tool Secure

This is a more complex version of the CloakTool which utilises RemoteEvents to ensure that there is server-side verification that the user is permitted to use the tool. This is done through a RemoteEvent fired by the Client which is listened for by the server. The server then checks if the client which fired is either in a specific group, has a specific rank, or within a specificed range of the rank id (realistically, this condition can be modified to meet whatever is desired, such as user age, name, even health) but the main function is to ensure that only specific groups have access to use the functionality of the tool.

Players who are using the tool (i.e "cloaked" are added to a table, this way when a player joins the game, the server fires to the client and applies the required transparency level for the player's model on the client-side, meaning that if someone new joins the game that has the privelege to see the "cloaked" user, they will have the correct transparency (in this case 0.5) applied on their client-side so they can see them, while other users cannot. This is also the same for anyone who switches between an in-game team that can't see them to one that can, and vise versa.
